### ‚ùì About
Infernal Ring is a classic 2D fighting game created in the Unity game engine with a familiar pixel art style, sporting an OST, original artwork, and a plethora of gameplay mechanics.

The game takes inspiration from such classic fighting games as Street Fighter, and newer fighting games such as Dragon Ball FighterZ, to make for a truly dynamic experience. The main mechanic of the game,
Rings, allows players to select among 9 unique playstyles at the beginning of a match, in addition to a color palette swap.

The game was undertaken by two sets of students under the same Senior Capstone team,
Team Ritual. In the spirit of competition with other members of our class, every team member poured countless hours, effort, and heart into the work presented into this project capping off our
college degrees (We hope it shows!). Thank you so much to the classmates and staff who made this game possible. Enter the Ring!
